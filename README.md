# C Sharp Practice

## Exercise 1
Create a console application project called **CSharpPractice** in Visual Studio.

## Exercise 2
Create a class called **StringManager** and make it public.

## Exercise 3
Create a public method that returns the length of a given string.

## Exercise 4
Create a public method that returns the number of appearances of a letter in a given string.

## Exercise 5
Create a public method that returns the number of the vowels of a given string.

## Exercise 6
Create a public method that returns the number of the words of a given phrase.

## Exercise 7
Create a public method that removes a certain character (given as a parameter) from a word and returns the word without that letter.

## Exercise 8
Create a public method that checks whether the two strings are equal. It should return *true* if that's the case, or *false* otherwise.

## Exercise 9
Create a public method that returns the string spelt backwards. It should return *true* if that's the case, or *false* otherwise.

## Exercise 10
Create a public method that checks whether a string is a palindrome. It should return *true* if that's the case, or *false* otherwise.

## Exercise 11
Create an interface called **IStringManager** which will contain the signatures of all the above methods. The class **StringManager** will implement this interface.

## Exercise 12
Create another class called **AnotherStringManager** which will also implement the interface **IStringManager**. This means that it will also have the methods described above.
Try to implement them with a different solution each.
